# injectorExample
It is a simple java project which is showing an example of using Google Guice.

Since it is not a Maven project you have to add the external dependencies manually. 
There are 2 external libraries that I am using for this project.

The libraries are -
1) Google Guice <br>
2) Google Guava

Following are the jars -
lib/guice-4.0.jar
lib/guava-20.0.jar
lib/javax.inject-1.jar
lib/aopalliance-1.0.jar


All these jars are accessible at one place in this directory -
